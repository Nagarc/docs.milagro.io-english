# Trust in the Internet is at an all time low.
## It's time for action.

We all make multiple trust assumptions every day. And in truth most of them are justified and we are rarely disappointed. Indeed it would be hard to imagine a more difficult environment than one in which most of our trust assumptions proved false. Maybe in the Garden of Eden we all originally trusted one another.

Test

## Example of MathJax

Three types of Elliptic curve are supported for the implementation of
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), but curves are limited to popular
families that support faster implementation. Weierstrass curves are
supported using the Short Weierstrass representation:-

$$y^2=x^3+Ax+B$$

where $A=0$ or $A=-3$. Edwards curves are supported using both regular
and twisted Edwards format:-

$$Ax^2+y^2=1+Bx^2y^2$$

where $A=1$ or $A=-1$. Montgomery curves are represented as:-

$$y^2=x^3+Ax^2+x$$

where $A$ must be small.

## Announcement List

Have we made progress on Grav? Because I am getting a lot of CousCous.
