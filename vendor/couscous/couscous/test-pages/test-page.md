# Introduction
One of the major mysteries in the real-world of crypto is resistance to the exploitation of new research ideas. Its not that cryptographic research has failed to throw up new ideas that have the potential for commercial exploitation -- far from it. But in the real-world 1970's crypto rules supreme, and very little happens that isn't PKI/RSA based. The reasons for this are many and varied. However one part of the puzzle might be the non-availability of easy-to-use open source cryptographic tools, that do not require in depth cryptographic expertise to deploy.

There are many crypto libraries out there. Many offer a bewildering variety of cryptographic primitives, at different levels of security. Many use extensive assembly language in order to be as fast as possible. Many are very big, even bloated. Some rely on other external libraries. Many were designed by academics for academics, and so are not really suitable for commercial use. Many are otherwise excellent, but not written in our favourite language.

The Apache Milagro Crypto Library (AMCL) is different <a href="#eason55">1</a>. AMCL is completely self-contained (except for the requirement for an external entropy source for random number generation). AMCL is for use in the pre-quantum era &ndash; that is in the here and now. With the advent of a workable quantum computer, AMCL will become history. But we are not expecting that to happen any time soon.
## Test of 2
### Test of 3

<p>Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use <q>(1)</q>, not <q>Eq. (1)</q> or <q>equation (1)</q>, except at the beginning of a sentence: <q>Equation (1) is . . .</q></p>

<h2>Some Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The word <q>data</q> is plural, not singular.</li>
  <li>The subscript for the permeability of vacuum μ0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter <q>o</q>.</li>
  <li>In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)</li>
  <li>A graph within a graph is an <q>inset</q>, not an <q>insert</q>. The word alternatively is preferred to the word <q>alternately</q> (unless you really mean something that alternates).</li>
  <li>Do not use the word <q>essentially</q> to mean <q>approximately</q> or <q>effectively</q>.</li>
  <li>In your paper title, if the words <q>that uses</q> can accurately replace the word <q>using</q>, capitalize the <q>u</q>; if not, keep using lower-cased.</li>
  <li>Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones <q>affect</q> and <q>effect</q>, <q>complement</q> and <q>compliment</q>, <q>discreet</q> and <q>discrete</q>, <q>principal</q> and <q>principle</q>.</li>
  <li>Do not confuse <q>imply</q> and <q>infer</q>.</li>
  <li>The prefix <q>non</q> is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.</li>
  <li>There is no period after the <q>et</q> in the Latin abbreviation <q>et al.</q>.</li>
  <li>The abbreviation <q>i.e.</q> means <q>that is</q>, and the abbreviation <q>e.g.</q> means <q>for example</q>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Using the Template</h1>
<p>After the text edit has been completed, the paper is ready for the template. Duplicate the template file by using the Save As command, and use the naming convention prescribed by your conference for the name of your paper. In this newly created file, highlight all of the contents and import your prepared text file. You are now ready to style your paper; use the scroll down window on the left of the MS Word Formatting toolbar.</p>

<h2>Authors and Affiliations</h2>
<p>The template is designed so that author affiliations are not repeated each time for multiple authors of the same affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization). This template was designed for two affiliations.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>For author/s of only one affiliation (Heading 3):</em> To change the default, adjust the template as follows.
    <ol>
      <li><em>Selection (Heading 4):</em> Highlight all author and affiliation lines.</li>
      <li><em>Change number of columns:</em> Select the Columns icon from the MS Word Standard toolbar and then select <q>1 Column</q> from the selection palette.</li>
      <li><em>Deletion:</em> Delete the author and affiliation lines for the second affiliation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>For author/s of more than two affiliations:</em> To change the default, adjust the template as follows.
    <ol>
      <li><em>Selection:</em> Highlight all author and affiliation lines.</li>
      <li><em>Change number of columns:</em> Select the <q>Columns</q> icon from the MS Word Standard toolbar and then select <q>1 Column</q> from the selection palette.</li>
      <li><em>Highlight author and affiliation lines of affiliation 1 and copy this selection.</em></li>
      <li><em>Formatting:</em> Insert one hard return immediately after the last character of the last affiliation line. Then paste down the copy of affiliation 1. Repeat as necessary for each additional affiliation.</li>
      <li><em>Reassign number of columns:</em> Place your cursor to the right of the last character of the last affiliation line of an even numbered affiliation (e.g., if there are five affiliations, place your cursor at end of fourth affiliation). Drag the cursor up to highlight all of the above author and affiliation lines. Go to Column icon and select <q>2 Columns</q>. If you have an odd number of affiliations, the final affiliation will be centered on the page; all previous will be in two columns.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Identify the Headings</h2>
<p>Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.</p>
<p>Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and References and, for these, the correct style to use is <q>Heading 5</q>. Use <q>figure caption</q> for your Figure captions, and <q>table head</q> for your table title. Run- in heads, such as <q>Abstract</q>, will require you to apply a style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop down menu to differentiate the head from the text.</p>
<p>Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named <q>Heading 1</q>, <q>Heading 2</q>, <q>Heading 3</q>, and <q>Heading 4</q> are prescribed.</p>

<h2>Figures and Tables</h2>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Positioning Figures and Tables:</em> Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation <q>Fig. 1</q>, even at the beginning of a sentence.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity <q>Magnetization</q>, or <q>Magnetization, M</q>, not just <q>M</q>. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write <q>Magnetization (A/m)</q> or <q>Magnetization {A[m(1)]}</q>, not just <q>A/m</q>. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write <q>Temperature (K)</q>, not <q>Temperature/K</q>.</p>

<h5>Acknowledgment <em>(Heading 5)</em></h5>
<p>The preferred spelling of the word <q>acknowledgment</q> in America is without an <q>e</q> after the <q>g</q>. Avoid the stilted expression <q>one of us (R. B. G.) thanks ...</q>. Instead, try <q>R. B. G. thanks...</q>. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.</p>

<h5 class="references">References</h5>
<p>The template will number citations consecutively within brackets <a href="#eason55">1</a>. The sentence punctuation follows the bracket <a href="#maxwell1892">2</a>. Refer simply to the reference number, as in <a href="#jacobs63">3</a>—do not use <q>Ref. <a href="#jacobs63">3</a></q> or <q>reference <a href="#jacobs63">3</a></q> except at the beginning of a sentence: <q>Reference <a href="#jacobs63">3</a> was the first ...</q></p>
<p>Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.</p>
<p>Unless there are six authors or more give all authors’ names; do not use <q>et al.</q>. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as <q>unpublished</q> <a href="#elissa">4</a>. Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as <q>in press</q> <a href="#nicole">5</a>. Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.</p>
<p>For papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation <a href="#yorozu87">7</a>.</p>
